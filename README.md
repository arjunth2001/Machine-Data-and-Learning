# Machine Data Learning

Assignments and Projects done as part of Machine, Data and Learning Course

## Contents

- Bias Variance Tradeoff / Linear Regression - Understanding bias and variace by plotting graphs after training a model for different polynomial functions.

- Genetic Algorithms Project - Applying the genetic algorithm and various heuristics over a long period as a project in various trails in order to reduce the overfitting i.e. generalize the model so that the model performs better on unseen data.

- Value Iteration Algorithm - Submission towards a handwritten assignment to solve a VI Problem and also a python Program to solve a game of Indiana Jones and Mighty Monster (MM) using Value Iteration Algorithm to find best policy.
- POMDP - Submissions towards a handwritten assignment and used SARSOP Solver to solve a POMDP.
